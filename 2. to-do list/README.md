# To-Do List (CLI-Based)
This is a simple **To-Do List application** built in Python for managing tasks via the terminal. It allows users to add, view, delete, mark tasks as done, and unmark them with ease.


## Features:
- Add tasks to your list.
- View all tasks with numbered indices.
- Delete specific tasks or clear all tasks at once.
- Mark tasks as completed with a special indicator `[●]`.
- Unmark tasks if needed.
- Easy-to-use menu with help functionality.


## Example Output:
```
Welcome to the to-do list app
-------------------------------
Enter 'h' to know how to use the app

What I want: h

[h] --> help you for understand app
[a] --> enter your task
[q] --> back to main menu
[s] --> show all your tasks
[d] --> delete your task
[m] --> Mark the task as done
[u] --> unmark the task as done
```

## Notes:
- All tasks are saved directly into the program's source code for simplicity.
- This project is for learning purposes and can be expanded to include advanced features.
